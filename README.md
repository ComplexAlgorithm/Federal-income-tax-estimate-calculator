# Federal-income-tax-estimate-calculator
Calculates a basic generic federal income tax for the year


Create a program that will help someone get an estimate of how much they might owe in federal
income taxes for the year. Allow the user to enter his or her income for the entire year. Based
on their income the program should determine their tax rate as well as an estimate for how much
they might owe. The tax rate and the amount of taxes they owe should be printed to the screen.
Use the following tax brackets for the program:
 10% on taxable income from $0 to $10,000
 20% on taxable income over $10,000 to $50,000
 30% on taxable income over $50,000 to $100,000
 40% on taxable income over $100,000
